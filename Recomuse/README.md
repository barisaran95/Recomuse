# Recomuse


	RecoMuse is basically a database driven website project that recommends music artists to people according to their taste. It provides sign up & login system, has a dashboard that shows most liked artists, has a library that shows the artists that the user liked and has a recommendation page that shows new artist the user may like. In order to sign up, an email, a username and a password is required, and the user should use the username and password to login to RecoMuse. If a new user is not happy with the most liked artists that shows up in the dashboard when he/she first logged in, he/she may use the search bar in the dashboard to like his/her favorite artists so that he/she can get recommendations based on his/her likes. Also, if a user likes an artist by mistake, he/she can remove the artist for his/her library so that it won’t affect his/her recommendations.
